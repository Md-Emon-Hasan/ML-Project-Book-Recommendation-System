## üìñ Introduction

This repository showcases a machine learning project aimed at recommending books to users based on their reading preferences, ratings, and behaviors. The recommendation system helps users discover books they might enjoy by analyzing past interactions.

---

## üîç Topics Covered

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Implementing collaborative filtering models for book recommendation.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommending books based on content similarity.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for preparing book data for modeling.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing recommendation system performance using precision, recall, and other metrics.
- **Deployment:** Implementing the recommendation system using Flask for a web-based interface.
